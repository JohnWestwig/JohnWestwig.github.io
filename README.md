All aspects of the project have been successfully completed.  I am not quite sure what format is recommended for résumés, and my (limited) online research was inconclusive.  I chose a fairly simple one to begin with.

I used tutorialspoint.com to learn more about HTML tags and CSS styles.

I spent approximately four (4) hours completing this assignment.
