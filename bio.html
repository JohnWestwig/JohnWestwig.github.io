    <h1>About John:</h1>
    <p>I was born and raised in Ithaca, NY, home of Cornell and the annual rutabaga curling competition. I attended Ithaca High School, where I focused on engineering, math and science classes.  Much of my time was spent working for the robotics team, playing ultimate frisbee and honing my chess skills.  I came to Tufts last year to pursue a degree in Computer Science through the School of Engineering.  I am passionate about all kinds of programming, and I am particularly excited to expand my proficiency in web-based languages and programming styles.  At Tufts, I continue to play Frisbee, have participated in various IM sports, and am helping to get Tufts Incubator, a haven for start-ups, off the ground.  I look forward to a fun and fruitful four years here.</p>
